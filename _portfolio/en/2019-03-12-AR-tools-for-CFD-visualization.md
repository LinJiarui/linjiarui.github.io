During my visit to E3D institute of RWTH-Aachen University, we developed a novel approach and a prototype tool based on Unity3D, for AR-based CFD visualization of indoor thermal environment. Details could be found in our [paper]({{site.baseurl}}/en/publications/2019-03-12-ar-based-cfd-visualization-for-indoor-thermal-environment). Source code and test data are also available [on github](https://github.com/smartaec/ARvis-CFD) for future research and investigations.
