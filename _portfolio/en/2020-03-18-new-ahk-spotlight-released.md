A few days ago, I developed a tool called [AHK Spotlight]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/portfolio/2020-03-06-ahk-spotlight-for-presentation) for online teaching and presentation purpose. Recently, quite a few people downloaded it and shared their thoughts and ideas on how to improve it. Yesterday, I spared half a day to improve it. New features include:

1. support rectangular spotlight;

2. support zooming spotlight using mouse wheel.

Instructions on how to use the tool:

1. Run your Powerpoint as usuall, and press `Shift` twice to activate Spotlight effect

2. Press `Esc` to escape Spotlight effect

3. Press Middle button of your mouse to switch rectangular spotlight and circle spotlight

4. Press `S+Up/Down` to zoom the circle

5. Scroll you wheel to zoom the spotlight
