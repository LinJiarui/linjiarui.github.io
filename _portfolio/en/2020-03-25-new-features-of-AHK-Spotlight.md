A few days ago, I developed a tool called [AHK Spotlight]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/portfolio/2020-03-06-ahk-spotlight-for-presentation) for online teaching and presentation purpose. Quite a few people downloaded it and shared their thoughts and ideas on how to improve it. Following previously updated [v1.6]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/2020-03-18-new-ahk-spotlight-released), v1.7 is release today, and it was totally re-designed with lots of enhancements. 

## Features and Instruction

1. Run your Powerpoint as usuall, and press `Shift` twice to activate Spotlight effect

2. Press `Esc` to escape Spotlight effect

3. Press Middle button of your mouse to switch between circle, square, and rectangle

4. Press `S+Up/Down` to zoom the virtical size

5. Press `S+Left/Right` to zoom the horizontal size (only for rectangular effect)

6. Scroll you wheel to zoom the virtical size

## How it looks like
