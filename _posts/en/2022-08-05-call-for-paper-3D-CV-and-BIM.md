## Topic Information
Dear Colleagues,

3D computer vision is an interdisciplinary subject involving computer vision, computer graphics, artificial intelligence and other fields. Its main contents include 3D perception, 3D understanding and 3D modeling. In recent years, 3D computer vision technology has been developed rapidly and has been widely used in unmanned aerial vehicle, robot, autonomous driving, AR, VR and other fields. Smart building and city use various information technologies or innovative concepts to connect and various systems and services, so as to improve the efficiency of resource utilization, optimize management and services, and improve the quality of life. The smart building and city can involve some frontier techniques like 3D CV for building information model, digital twins, city information model, simultaneous localization and mapping, robot, etc. The applications of 3D computer vision in smart building and city is a valuable research direction, but it still faces many major challenges in theory and technology. This topic focuses on the theory and technology of 3D computer vision in smart building and city. We invite the research community to publish papers and provide innovative technologies, theories or case studies.
