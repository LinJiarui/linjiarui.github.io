The sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic has brought severe challenges to all the industries. However, opportunities and changes always come with challenges. Online collaboration, teaching, etc., have become a new trend. In the post-epidemic era, advanced information technology will be deeply integrated with the construction industry and accelerate the transformation and upgrading of the industry.

To this end, we organized a symposium on _Digital Transformation of Construction Industry after COVID-19 Pandemic_ in Taiyuan, China. Four young scholars (Prof. Zhen Xu, Mr. Fangqiang Yu, Dr. Yichuan Deng, Dr. Fan Xue) are invited to talk about CIM, disaster prevention, smart construction, blockchain.

The symposium is held both online and offline, and attracted more than 1000 scholars.
