On September 20, 2023, the buildingSMART International Standards Summit in Lillestr√∏m, Norway. On behalf of our group, I presented our projected entitled "knowledge-informed rule interpretation and automated design checking based on openBIM". And we are delighted that our work is selected as the winner in the category of professional research of the 2023 buildingSMART openBIM Awards.
