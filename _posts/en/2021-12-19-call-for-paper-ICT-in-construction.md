Dear Colleagues,

The construction industry has long been an engine of global economic growth. Despite the boom, the construction industry is faced with many challenges, such as lagging productivity, labor sustainability, and environmental sustainability. Considering the above challenges, industrial transformation and upgrade become critical for the continuous and healthy development of the construction industry.

Intelligent construction provides a solution to these challenges. In the past two decades, we have witnessed significant efforts in leveraging intelligent and computer technologies to enhance the construction project delivery process. Examples include but are not limited to smart site supervision, construction robotics, automatic safety, and health management with the IoT. Intelligent construction is a complicated topic related to the whole life cycle of a project. With the advancement of intelligent and computer technologies, there is still room for researchers and industry practitioners to further facilitate digital and intelligent transformation in construction.

This Special Issue aims to provide a platform to explore state-of-the-art knowledge, practical implementation, and cutting-edge innovations in the area of intelligent and computer technologiesâ€™ application in construction.
