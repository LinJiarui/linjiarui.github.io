Dr. Jia-Rui Lin is currently a research assistant professor at the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Institute of Tsinghua University, and concurrently the director of the Mechanics Computing and Simulation Laboratory of the Mechanics Experimental Teaching Center of Tsinghua University. He obtained his bachelor's degree (2011) and Ph.D. (2016) from the Department of Civil Engineering of Tsinghua University. After finished his postdoctoral research in 2018, he joined the New Technologies for Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Group of Tsinghua University.

His research interests are information technology for building and civil engineering, including building information model (BIM), augmented reality (AR) ,cloud computing and internet of things (IoT). He is committed to optimizing performance and improving decision-making process in the construction, operation, maintenance, and disaster prevention of buildings and infrastructures through advanced information technology.

Recently, he was granted by the national key R&D Program, national science foundation of China and other organizations for about 10 projects, and has published more than 40 peer-reviewed journal and conference papers. He also holds 8 software copyrights. Main contributions include:

* A BIM model targets the whole building lifecycle, which can integrate design information, performance simulation, and sensing data into a single model. The model was tested in the simulation and sensing of building performance and structural performance of bridges.
* BIM-based cloud platform for buildings and infrastructures: a hybrid cloud platform is designed and implemented based on NoSQL databases (including MongoDB and HBase), which can process, search and visualize large-scale information models, and can also integrate data from multi-stakeholders while keeps their data ownership.
* Spatial-semantic data mining of BIM: proposed a series methods for multi-aspect similarity evaluation of BIM models, operation & maintenance data mining, and on-site inspection data mining, which can improve the efficiency of residential design, construction management, and maintenance.
