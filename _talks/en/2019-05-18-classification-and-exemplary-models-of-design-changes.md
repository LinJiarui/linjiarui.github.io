The 6th ross-Strait Forum on Sustainable Urban Development was held at Tongji Unviersity on May 17 and 18. Since I had a class these days, on behalf of me, my master student, Mr. Yu-Cheng Zhou, gave a talk on "Classification and Exemplary BIM Models Developments of Design Changes", which comes from our accepted paper of ISARC. Previous work always uses data changes and design changes in a mixed way, we try to provide a classification method of design changes from the engineers' or designers' point of view, and sample BIM models for test purposes are developed. With our work, new methods for design change detection could be developed and validated.
