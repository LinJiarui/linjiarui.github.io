The 2nd National Conference on Computing and Simulation Technology in Civil Engineering was held in Beijing on May 14-16, 2021. On behalf of our group, Mr. Ming-Hui Wu presents our recent work on modeling and simulation of human-robot collaboration in construction based on agent-based modeling. Findings in this research could guide the optimization of human-robot collaboration and improve the efficiency and safety of complex construction processes.
