The 36th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction (ISARC) was held at Banff on May 21-24. I gave a talk on "Classification and Exemplary BIM Models Developments of Design Changes". Since previous work always uses data changes and design changes in a mixed way, we try to provide a classification method of design changes from the engineers' or designers' point of view, and sample BIM models for test purposes are developed. With our work, new methods for design change detection could be developed and validated. I also served as a session chair in this conference.
