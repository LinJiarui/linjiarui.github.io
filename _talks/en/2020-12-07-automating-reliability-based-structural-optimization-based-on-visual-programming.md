The 8th International Conference on Construction Engineering and Project Management (ICCEPM 2020) is held on December 7-8, 2020 in Hong  Kong. The conference is co-organized by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Due to the pandemic of COVID-19, the conference is held in a hybrid mode. In this conference, I gave a talk titled "A Framework to Automate Reliability-based Structural Optimization based on Visual Programming and OpenSees". I introduced a new framework for automatic reliability evaluation and optimization of structures based on visual programming and OpenSees.
