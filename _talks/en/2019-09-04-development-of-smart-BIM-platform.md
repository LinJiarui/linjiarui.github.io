On September 4, 2019, I was invited by the China Electric Power Construction Association, to give a talk on "Development of Smart BIM Platform for Construction Projects". In this talk, I introduced research and development of 4D-BIM cloud platform from Tsinghua BIM group. Then, recently development (including knowledge reusing, integration of sensing and simulation technologies, intelligent data retrieval, and augmented reality) to make the platform smarer are shared and discussed. It is concluded that digital twin that integrates IoT, BIM, and simulations for smart construction will be widely used in the near future.
