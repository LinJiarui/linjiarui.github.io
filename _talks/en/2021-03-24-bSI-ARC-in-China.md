On March 24, 2021, I was invited to dilvery a talk on the buildingSMART Virtual Summit Spring 2021. The topic is about recent development and practice of automatic rule checking (ARC) in China. In this talk, recent government policies, practices, emerging tools and startups related to ARC are summarized. Check [here](https://www.buildingsmart.org/virtual-summit-spring-2021/) for detail. You can also find this video on [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/540119979).
