Invited by Dr. Nan Li, I gave a talk to his group and other graduate students from my department. The title of my talk is "Smart Decision Making based on Digital Twin". In this talk, I shared our recent work on: 1) the creation of digital twin of bridges or buildings based on BIM and IoT, for construction safety and building performance management; 2) knowledge discovery based on digital twin, to extract hidden topics and collaboration patterns from on-site inspection data; 3) human-computer interaction based AR and NLP, for better communication of indoor thermal design and intellgient retrieval of complex engineering data; 4) automatic compliance checking and smart design based on rule checking.
