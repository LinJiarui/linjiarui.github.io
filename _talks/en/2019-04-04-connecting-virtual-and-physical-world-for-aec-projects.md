On April 3 and 4, 2019, I visited RWTA-Aachen University to attend the expert meeting of IBPSA Project 1. Prof. Dawei Wang and Dr. Pengfei Liu invited me to give a talk to their group. This talk is about connecting the virtual and physical world by AR, IoT, BIM and cloud computing to achieve efficient decision-making process. I shared two recent work we did: one is about AR-based CFD visualization for indoor thermal environment design, another one is closed-loop safety management of bridge construction based on time dependent structural analysis and data sensing.
