This research is part of a National Key R&D Program of China called "Knowledge Base and Service Platform for Intelligent Standards in the Building and Construction Area". Objetive of this research is to develop knowledge base or knowledge graph of building codes and standards, which could be easily accessed and interpreted by both humans and machines, enabling Q&A, reasoning, and open access of building codes, standards, and other regulatory documents in the AEC domain.

I'm the Principal Investigator of this research.
