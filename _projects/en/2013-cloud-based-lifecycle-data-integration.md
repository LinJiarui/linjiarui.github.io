In view of the existing deficiencies and urgent requirements of applying Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies in Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Facility Management (AEC /FM) industry, this research proposes a BIM system framework for various stages and different applications in building lifecycle, based on industry foundation classes (IFC) standard and cloud computing technology, a newly-emerged IT technology worldwide. Then, a progressive and multi-participants oriented modeling method is generated, followed by in-depth researches on some key technologies, such as distributed storage and management of BIM data, BIM data integration and fusion, sub-model extraction, BIM server and application mechanism based on process, etc. Finally, a cloud-computing-based BIM integration and server platform (BIMISP) will be developed. The purpose of this research is to present a set of BIM theories, methods, technologies and system platform, to support BIM data sharing, lossless delivery and application among the whole building lifecycle including planning, design, construction, and operation and maintenance phases. The prospective findings will be useful for improving efficiency and quality of building activities,
reducing resource consumption, and implementing sustainable development strategy during building lifecycle. 

I was the core memeber of the team, and finished research related to MVD development, data integration and MongoDB-based cloud database design and implementation.
