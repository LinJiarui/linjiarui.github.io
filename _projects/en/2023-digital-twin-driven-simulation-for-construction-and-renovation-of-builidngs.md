This research is part of a National Key R&D Program of China called "Twinning and Visual Simulation of Construction and Renovation Process Considering Performance, Quality, Safety". Objetive of this research is to develop noval simulation and optimization method based on digital twin and reinforcement learning, to adaptively simulate, control the construction and renovation process with multiple constraints such as safety, quality, cost, etc.

I'm the Principal Investigator of this research.
