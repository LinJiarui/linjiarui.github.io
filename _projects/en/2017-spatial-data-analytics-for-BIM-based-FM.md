I'm the Principal Investigator of this project, and the objective is to enrich BIM model with topological connections between spaces and equipments, which could be further used for facility management.  First, 3D voxelization and voxel-growing are used to automatically detect and reconstruct indoor spaces, and connect them with their surrounding elements. Thus, connections between spaces, equipments could be created and enriched. Finally, data mining is utilized to identify spaces and equipments with high priority during O&M phase. Meanwhile, reconstructed spaces and their connections are also used to find a way to the space where maintenance of equipments is needed.
