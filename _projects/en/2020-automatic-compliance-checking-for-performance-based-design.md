Objective of this project is to integrate semantic reasoning and performance simulation for automatic compliance checking of fire protection design. In this project, BIM, ontology, rule checking, and AI are utilized to build a unified semantic model for reasoning and simulation purpose, and a prototype system with integration of reasoning engine and simulation is developed to automatically check a fire protection design.

I'm the Principal Investigator of this project.
