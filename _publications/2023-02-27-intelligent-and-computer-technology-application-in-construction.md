在建造设4.0的新时代，大量智能信息技术和先进管理手段的应用，推动了智能建造监管（ICM）的快速发展。然而，目前尚缺乏ICM成熟度或智慧化发展水平的评价方法。因此，本研究通过文献调研、问卷调查、专家访谈和案例分析，建立了ICM成熟度评价的指标体系和评价方法。该体系共包括五个评价维度、二十个评价指标及其对应的指标权重、成熟度评价表等，研究同时设计了相应的成熟度等级和成熟度对比雷达图。对两家建筑企业的评估案例分析研究表明，所提出的评估体系可以有效定量评估企业ICM的成熟度水平。同时，本研究还为不同成熟度等级的建筑企业提出了提高ICM成熟度的实用改进方法。此外，研究还探讨了行业近期应重点关注的前沿发展方向。
The construction industry is faced with many challenges, such as lagging productivity [1], labor sustainability [2], and environmental sustainability [3]. Intelligent construction provides a solution to these challenges. In the past two decades, significant efforts have been devoted to enhancing the construction project delivery process using intelligent and computer technologies. Examples include, but are not limited to, smart site supervision [4], construction robotics [5], automatic safety [6], and health management with the IoT [7]. This Special Issue aims to provide a platform to explore state-of-the-art knowledge, practical implementation, and cutting-edge innovations in the area of intelligent and computer technologies’ application in construction. A total of fourteen original research studies have been published, with contributions from international research groups. All these contributions address the main topics of this Special Issue with an effective and targeted effort.

he guest editors would like to acknowledge all the authors for their scientific support and kind sharing of their knowledge. The editors would like to express their gratitude to the peer reviewers for their rigorous analysis of manuscripts as well as the managing editors of Buildings involved in this Special Issue for their continuous support.
