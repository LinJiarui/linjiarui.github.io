Construction is the pillar industry of Chinese national economy, but the profit rate has continued to decline in recent years. The conventional job-centric construction information system cannot meet the requirements for safety, quality, and efficiency. In order to solve the above problems, a digital selves based intelligent construction framework has been proposed which is centred on workers, equipment, and sites. It changes the conventional job-centered construction information system and realizes efficient coordination of information among various departments and stages. Applying the digital selves based intelligent construction framework to the case has been proved to be a good solution to the problem of information sharing. Meanwhile, the authenticity and reliability of the information have been ensured. The system has improved management efficiency and information systematization for all participants. It has enabled companies and workers to have a more comprehensive understanding of themselves and to make timely and effective strategies against hazards. In addition, the system has effectively raised the level of digitalization, automation, and intelligence of construction, making governance more accurate and more effective.
