In modern infrastructure operation and maintenance management, data types are diverse and their sources are complex. How to effectively integrate and utilize this data has become a critical issue that urgently needs to be addressed. This research focuses on the semantic extraction, integration, and application of multi-source heterogeneous operation and maintenance data, aiming to improve semantic interoperability by addressing the high degree of structural heterogeneity among various data types. The study constructs an infrastructure operation and maintenance data integration method based on BIM and ontology. Taking a tunnel operation and maintenance scenario as an example, the feasibility of the constructed hybrid ontology model in actual engineering is verified.
