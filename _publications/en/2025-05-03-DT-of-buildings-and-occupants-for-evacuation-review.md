excerpt: 'This study, by analyzing literature from 2004 to 2025, proposes a digital twin framework for emergency evacuation that integrates buildings, occupants, and their interaction mechanisms. The research shows that the current related technologies are mostly at the L0 - L2 maturity level. In the future, multidisciplinary collaboration is required to optimize data integration, improve the performance of sensors and algorithms, integrate emerging artificial intelligence technologies while addressing data ethics issues, and enhance robustness of DT systems.'

Buildings face threats from various emergencies, with emergency evacuation being a key measure for occupant safety. However, enhancing evacuation efficiency necessitates detailed studies of building characteristics and human behaviors. Despite this, a systematic review of digital twin technologies for emergency evacuation is still lacking. Therefore, by collecting and analyzing literature from 2004 to 2025 using PRISMA methodology, this study first proposes a conceptual digital twin framework that integrates buildings, occupants, and their interactions, encompassing the entire loop of sensing, updating, simulation, and decision-making. The current research has made significant progresses in areas such as basic virtual modeling, one-way data mapping, and preliminary bidirectional interaction. However, studies and applications of digital twins remain in the developmental stage, with most at maturity levels L0-L2, while L4-L5 applications are still relatively scarce. It is suggested that the future development of digital twin-based evacuation systems must rely on multidisciplinary collaboration to achieve breakthroughs, including optimizing underlying mechanisms to enhance data and system integration; improving sensing accuracy and developing adaptive algorithms for simulation and prediction; integrating emerging artificial intelligence technologies while addressing data ethics; and enhancing computational efficiency to strengthen system robustness.
