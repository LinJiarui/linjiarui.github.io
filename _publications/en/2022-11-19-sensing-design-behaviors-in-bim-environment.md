Design behavior is an important factor affecting design efficiency and quality. However, there still lacks effective means to collect design behavior data, and it is difficult to make full use of a large amount of design behavior data generated by BIM software to identify the relationship between design behavior and productivity. This paper proposes a multi-modal sensing method to collect design behavior data in BIM environment, and conducts a systematic analysis in terms of data requirements, characteristics, and collection methods, and finally conducts a technical verification based on Revit. The research shows that the approach proposed in this paper has good usability, and the collected data is of great significance for studying the characteristics of design behavior and its impact on productivity.
