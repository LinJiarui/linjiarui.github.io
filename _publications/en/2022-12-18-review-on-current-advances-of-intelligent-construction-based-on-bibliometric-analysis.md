With the development of information technologies and the transformation and upgrading of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, intelligent construction is gaining increasing attention. Integrating with construction industrialization, intelligent construction has become an important way to achieve high-quality development of the AEC industry. To grasp the research development status of intelligent construction and explore future research opportunities, this study takes the database of Web of Science (WOS) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) as the data source and carries out a bibliometric analysis of related research based on VOSviewer and Gephi. For English articles, the studies earlier focused on theoretical methods and gradually transitioned to the engineering practice. Although it starts relatively later according to Chinese articles, intelligent construction has a rapid development in recent years and shows close interactions with engineering practice. Finally, this paper puts forward research prospects, in order to provide some directions for the research of intelligent construction and contribute to the upgrading and transformation of the AEC industry.
