The safety of water supply pipeline components is of great significance to the operation of water supply system. Corrosion is one of the important natural phenomena causing the reduction of reliability of buried pipelines. In this paper, a reliability analysis is conducted on a Building Information Model (BIM) model of Zijing water supply pipe system considering hydrodynamics. The time-varying reliability of each pipe and the upper and lower bound of system reliability under corrosion effect is calculated. The influence of structural properties and working conditions to the pipeline corrosion degradation process is also discussed based on a clustering analysis. It is shown the calculation results provide insightful information for the maintenance of pipeline and thus making better maintenance strategy.

We won the best paper award in this conference.
