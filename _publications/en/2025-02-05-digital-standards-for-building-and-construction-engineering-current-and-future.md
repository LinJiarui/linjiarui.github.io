To promote the development of digitalization and intelligence of construction engineering standards，achieving the machine readability and computability of standard specifications，this paper has conducted research on the current state of standard digitalization，and proposed a grading model for the development stages of construction engineering standard digitalization and its typical application scenarios，providing a clear development path for the process of standard digitalization. Meanwhile，a key technical framework for the digitalization of construction engineering standards covering the intelligent interpretation of existing standards，intelligent compilation of incremental standards，and multi-scenario application of standards has been established. A systematic review of the research and application status，future needs，and key challenges of the key technologies in each part of the framework has also been conducted. Currently，significant progress has been made in knowledge extraction，rule interpretation，collaborative design，intelligent review，and other areas，providing strong support for the digitalization of standards. However，the complete realization of the digital transformation of standards still requires time and further exploration in aspects such as standard digital models，intelligent interpretation and compilation of standards，and multi-scenario applications，combining technologies such as large multimodal models（LMMs）.
