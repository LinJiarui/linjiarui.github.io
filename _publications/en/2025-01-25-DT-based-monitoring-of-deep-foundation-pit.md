Underground space development has significantly increased the depth, scale, and complexity of foundation pit engineering. However, monitoring systems lack mechanical analysis models and fail to predict and control construction risks. Additionally, the foundation pit model could not be updated based on on-site observed data, leading to inaccurate predictions. This study proposes a DT modeling framework for foundation pits, which is used to simulate, predict, and control the risks associated with the entire excavation process. Consequently, based on the DT modeling framework, a DT foundation pit model (DTFPM) was established using modeling and updating algorithms. This study summarizes and identifies the key modeling parameters of foundation pits. A parametric modeling algorithm based on ABAQUS (v2020) was developed to drive the excavation pit modeling process within seconds. Furthermore, an inverse analysis optimization algorithm based on genetic algorithms (GA) and real-time observed deformation was employed to update the elastic modulus of the soil. The algorithm supports parallel computing and can converge within 10 generations. The prediction error of the model after inverse analysis can be reduced to within 10%. Finally, the authors applied DTFPM to establish an intelligent monitoring system. The focus is on real-time and predictive warnings based on the monitoring deformation of the current construction step and the updated model. This study analyzes a Beijing project case to verify the effectiveness of the system, demonstrating the practical application of the proposed method. The results showed that the DTFPM could accurately simulate the deformation behavior of the foundation pit. The system could provide more timely and accurate safety warnings. The proposed method can potentially contribute to the intelligent construction of foundation pits in the future, both theoretically and practically.
