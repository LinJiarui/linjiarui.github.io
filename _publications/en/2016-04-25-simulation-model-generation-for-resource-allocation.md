Abstract
====

To eliminate low effort and complicated model process needed in data modeling for resource allocation, a BIM-based approach to automatically generate discrete event simulation ( DES) model for resource allocation was proposed．Firstly, a model was established based on IFC to model schedule and resource information．Then，with comparison of IFC model and DES model，automatic conversion from the former to the latter was achieved．Finally, taking simulated annealing as the optimization module, a model generation and optimization application was developed for resource allocation，and was validated in a real project．Results show that automatic generation of DES model can reduce mistakes and avoid rework in resource allocation modeling, thus facilitating decision making in schedule and resource trade off．
