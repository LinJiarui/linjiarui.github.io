Earthquakes have a deep impact on wide areas, and emergency rescue operations may benefit from social media information about the scope and extent of the disaster. Therefore, this work presents a text miningbased approach to collect and analyze social media data for early earthquake impact analysis. First, disasterrelated microblogs are collected from the Sina microblog based on crawler technology. Then, after data cleaning a series of analyses are conducted including (1) the hot words analysis, (2) the trend of the number of microblogs, (3) the trend of public opinion sentiment, and (4) a keyword and rule-based text classification for earthquake impact analysis. Finally, two recent earthquakes with the same magnitude and focal depth in China are analyzed to compare their impacts. The results show that the public opinion trend analysis and the trend of public opinion sentiment can estimate the earthquake's social impact at an early stage, which will be helpful to decision-making and rescue management.
