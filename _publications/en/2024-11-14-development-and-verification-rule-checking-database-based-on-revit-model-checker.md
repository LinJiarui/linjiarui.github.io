Rule checking based on BIM plays a key role in improving design quality. Traditional manual methods are prone to errors and inefficient, and there is an urgent need for automated rule checking methods. However, there is still a lack of rule checking database for China, and further testing of their application effects is needed. This study analyzes the specification provisions and builds an rule checking database for Chinese building standards based on the Revit Model Checker plug-in, and conducts application tests in actual engineering projects. The results show that for specification provisions that only involve the value of a single component attribute, the plug-in can create relevant rules and realize automatic rule checking, but for specification provisions involving spatial relationships or multi-component relationship characteristics, it is still difficult to efficiently realize the creation and checking of rules. At the same time, the rule checking database proposed in this paper shows high applicability in the automated application of multiple conventional rules, but it also puts forward higher requirements for the modeling guidelines of BIM models.
