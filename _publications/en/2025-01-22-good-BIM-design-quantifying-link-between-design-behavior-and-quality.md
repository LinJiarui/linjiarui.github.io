In the Architecture Engineering & Construction (AEC) industry, how design behaviors impact design quality remains unclear. This paper proposes the first approach that identifies and quantitatively describes the relationship between design behaviors and design quality based on Building Information Modeling (BIM). Real-time collection and log mining are integrated to collect raw data on design behaviors. Feature engineering and various machine learning models are then utilized for quantitative modeling and interpretation. Results confirm an existing quantifiable relationship which can be learned by various models. The best-performing model using Extremely Random Trees achieved an R2 value of 0.88 on the test set. Behavioral features related to designer's skill level and changes of design intentions are identified as having significant impacts on design quality. These findings deepen our understanding of the design process and can help us create BIM designs of better quality.
