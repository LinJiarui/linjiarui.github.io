Modular buildings, due to their advantages in standardization, energy conservation, and environmental protection, are receiving increasing attention in the development of industrialized construction. However, the complexity of their design process poses challenges to traditional design methods. In recent years, generative design methods have been widely introduced into the field of modular buildings, becoming a key path to improve the level of intelligent design. This paper focuses on the automatic generation method of modular building layouts. First, it outlines the digital representation methods of modular building layouts, laying the data foundation for algorithm generation. Then, it discusses in detail two types of automatic generation methods: those based on optimization algorithms and those based on deep learning, analyzing their respective principles, processes, and applicable scenarios. Finally, it summarizes the current challenges and looks forward to future research directions.
