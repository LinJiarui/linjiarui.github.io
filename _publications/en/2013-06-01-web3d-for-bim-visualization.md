BIM Server provides a solution for BIM to support construction life cycle．Currently, the structure of BIM Server is C／S, but gradually B／S also shows its advantages. The
release of the HTML5 standard brings the WebGL technology which supports hardware graphics acceleration in browser and is one of a series of revolutionary Web technologies．Thereby
the foundation is laid for achieving Web—oriented BIM information management and 3D display of BIM model．In this paper, the model information scope and its expression of Web-oriented BIM is analyzed，and the corresponding information management technology and the BIM model display based on the Three.js, which is a WebGL framework, are studied．Then, a WebGL-based platform for 3D display and information management of BIM is also developed．Application shows that the graphics platform of the platform performs
stable with nice rendering for large BIM．Meanwhile the platform provides rich feature supports for Web client by favorable interactive functions, showing a great application value．
