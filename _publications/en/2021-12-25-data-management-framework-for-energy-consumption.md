By analyzing the requirements for energy consumption management during the building operation and maintenance period, this research summarizes the required energy management data and its characteristics, and basic principles for the management of energy consumption data. Thus, a unified data management framework for energy consumption management is proposed. Based on the framework, end users from different organizations and regions can access and analyze energy consumption data through the same protocols. Meanwhile, required key techniques for the development of energy management platform are also discussed.
