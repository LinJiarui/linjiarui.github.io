====

The digital transformation of construction safety management needs to be guided by extensive domain knowledge. In view of the large amount of safety production data accumulated in the construction industry, the introduction of knowledge graph technology can realize the transformation from data integration to knowledge integration, and improve the value density and application breadth of information. This study selects the field of highway engineering safety as the research object, provides knowledge support for engineering safety management through the construction of knowledge graph, and shows the guiding role of knowledge graph for safety management in the actual scenario based on the BIM model example
