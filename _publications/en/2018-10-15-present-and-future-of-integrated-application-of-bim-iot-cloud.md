Recently, increasing attention has been paid to cloud computing, big data and internet of things and their integration with building information modeling (BIM) technology in construction projects. However, a unified integrated application framework has not been established. Based on extensive literature review, this paper holds that cloud computing,  big data, internet of things and BIM are all necessary to serve construction project management. In this light, a unified integrated application framework was built. Additionally, we reviewed previous studies and applications of integration of BIM and related technologies, as well as the state of art of key technology and software development, giving a summary of existing applications. Finally, this paper discusses the challenges and future trends,  pointing out that further research needs to focus on basic theory and multi-technology integration.
