At present, featuring large capacity, high efficiency, little pollution and low energy consumption, the subway system has become one of the most popular modes for travel. In recent years, frequent extreme meteorological disasters, floods and other disasters have brought great impact on the operation of subway system and personnel safety. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient simulation method based on BIM for subway pedestrian evacuation under the influence of flood. A series of simulation experiments show that factors such as flood intrusion single-width flow rate, inlet width, station layout and number of evacuated pedestrians have significant influence on the subway pedestrian evacuation process under flood. In order to effectively improve evacuation efficiency, relevant measures should be taken to reduce intrusion single-width flow rate, inlet width and optimize station layout.
