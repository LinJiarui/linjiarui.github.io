 With the increasing scale and complexity of engineering projects, the application of Building Information Modeling(BIM) continues to deepen, and the Information volume stored by the engineering Information carrier represented by BIM model in each stage of the whole life cycle of construction projects gradually expands. The project information sharing not only improves the efficiency of the project construction, but also causes the practitioners to pay attention to the data security problem. The General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) issued by the EU is the most extensive, demanding and punishing law in the field of Data security at present, setting a new international benchmark in the field of data and information protection. BIM model, as a single data source of engineering, has similarities with GDPR principle no matter in terms of data information scope or information security principle. Therefore, on the basis of studying the current BIM standards and specifications in China, the security requirements of software and platform and user usage protocols, this paper makes a comparative analysis of the BIM and GDPR data processing principles respectively to study their suitability. Analyze the reference significance of GDPR data processing principle to solve the problems in the field of engineering information security; Finally, some suggestions are put forward for data information security protection in the process of engineering information sharing.
