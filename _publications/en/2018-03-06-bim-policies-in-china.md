Abstract
====

Taking recent published policies related to information technology and construction industry as the background，this paper reviews building information modeling (BIM) related policies issued by government departments at different levels in from December，2013 to December, 2017．Meanwhile, text mining methods like keywords extraction and word co-occurrence analysis were adopted to investigate the evolution of BIM related policies in different regions and the integration of other policies in the construction industry． It is illustrated that BIM related policies have transformed from the stage of demonstration and promotion to the stage of integration and expansion．In the future, policies related to BIM, assembled building, and the internet will be further combined for integrated management, smart decision making, and the improvement of quality and efficiency, which will lead to a sustainable future of the construction industry．
