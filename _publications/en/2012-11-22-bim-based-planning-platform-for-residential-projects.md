Abstract
====

According to the actual demand of housing project，by integrating BIM and 4D technology，the method of BIM modelling，program analysis and evaluation for housing program based on existing standard house type was put forward． Problems including associating economic and green performance information with 3D model of house type，management of house type model database，assembling house types into typical floor，formation of building，program analysis and evaluation on the foundation of economic indexes calculation and green performance analysis were solved，thereby coming with the BIM-based Housing Project Planning System based on Autodesk Revit 2012 and 4D project management system． The result of practical application illustrates that the approach for BIM modelling，program analysis，and decision making of housing project proposed in this paper was effective，which will promote the application of BIM in housing project planning．
