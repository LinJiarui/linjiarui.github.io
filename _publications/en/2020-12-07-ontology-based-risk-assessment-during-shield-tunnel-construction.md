The complexity and risk of tunnel construction always affect people, economy, and environment. But the management, sharing and reusing of risk knowledge of tunnel construction have always been inconvenient due to the weakness of traditional information management methods such as the relational database. However, currently, ontology has become an important method of knowledge representation, management, sharing and reusing, which enables efficient and semantic information retrieval and highly facilitates knowledge sharing and reusing, and it can be the solution for the above problems. At present, few studies focus on the use of ontology of tunnel construction, and the ontologies built by them still have some shortcomings. For example, the solutions for risk must be given by reasoning (e.g. SWRL), and the construction order and hierarchy cannot be expressed. In this paper, an ontology of shield tunnel construction is developed and then applied based on WBS and risk analysis of the shield tunnel construction, which eliminates the shortcomings mentioned above. Firstly, this paper makes WBS of shield tunnel construction. Secondly, the risk analysis of shield tunnel construction is developed after proposing the relationships between risk factors, risk precursor, and risk accidents and collecting relevant data of the above three risks. Then, the ontology of shield tunnel construction is developed by Protégé. Finally, the ontology is applied. This paper takes an actual shield tunnel subway construction project as an example, creates its related instances and uses SPARQL to query the risks and corresponding solutions in it. The results show that the risks and corresponding solutions can be correctly identified, which can provide a guidance for construction safety.
