Abstract
====

According to the key requirements in schedule and resource management during construction, an approach for schedule-resource trade-off problem was established based on 4 Dimensional Building Information Model (4D-BIM) proposed by Tsinghua．With the transforming mechanics between 4D-BIM and Discrete Event Simulation model, schedule-resource trade-off model can be achieved automatically．In addition, the paper explores and analyses the process of SA algorithm in order to tackle the schedule-resource trade-off．The whole solution was applied to a real project and illustrated a good result．The result indicates that the automatic schedule-resource tradeoff modelling can free people from intensive work, and reduces repetitive work, which provides managers with a practical tool for schedule arrangement and resource allocation．
