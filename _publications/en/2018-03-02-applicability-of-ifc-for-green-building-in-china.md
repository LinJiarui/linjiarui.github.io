Abstract
====

Various data fragmented in different data formats are involved in green building evaluation. Nowadays, building information modeling (BIM) emerges as a new way to integrate all these data into a single repository to improve efficiency and facilitate the adoption of green building. However, due  to  lack  of  both  BIM  software  and  information  model  supporting  green  building  evaluation  in China,  it  is  difficult  to  evaluate  lifecycle  performance  of  a  green  building  in  China.  Thus,  by analyzing  China’s  green  building  evaluation  standard,  information  requirements  for  green  building evaluation were extracted. Then, applicability of industrial foundation classes (IFC) to describe and support China’s green building evaluation standard was assessed. Results of this research can be of great value in the establishment and development of the information model specialized for China’s green building evaluation, and it will also assist the formation of the information delivery standard and the study of BIM tools for green building evaluation.
