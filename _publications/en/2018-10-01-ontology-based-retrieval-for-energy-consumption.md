Abstract
====

A large number of different forms of energy consumption information are generated during facility management. In addition, due to the uncertain and ambiguous external and internal environment of construction project, it is an important issue in energy consumption for operation staff to query required information efficiently. Moreover, implementations of BIM technology can provide visualization and integrated information models for FM. In view of the above two aspects, this paper introduces ontology as the modeling approach for information exchange and put forward a semantic retrieval method based on ontology for building energy management. Then this paper realizes the integration between ontology based semantic retrieval system and energy consumption information under BIM environment. In the case study, this paper constructs a domain ontology of energy consumption and then conducts retrieval expansion based on this information model, and the discussion of example provides support for further research.
