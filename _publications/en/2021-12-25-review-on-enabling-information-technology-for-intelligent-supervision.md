In order to improve the capacity and efficiency of construction project supervision, it is urgent to develop intelligent supervision methods based various information technologies. At present, scholars have investigated a large number of ICT technologies for construction supervision. This paper sorts out corresponding enabling information technologies, extracts and summarizes them into different categories according different tasks involved in construction supervision. This work provides a guidance for construction supervision companies on how to adopts relevant technologies to improve their construction management and decision-making processes.
