The  preliminary  stage  of  a  residential  real  estate  project  is  of  great importance but also is known to be with poor efficiency. However, residential real 
estate project contains numerous built standard units such as dwelling units and floors.  By  introducing  BIM,  this  research  tapped  the  full  potential  of  this advantage  to  improve  the  performance  of  the  preliminary  plan  modeling  in residential  real  estate  projects.  This  research  proposed  a  standard-unit-based modeling approach which contains 3 main steps: 1) standard unit management, 2) rapid plan modeling and 3) in-time estimation. By integrating functions such as intelligent  standard  unit  boundary  revision,  sun  analysis,  multi-level  and information-based model visualization, a prototype system was developed based on  this  approach,  and  was  applied  to  a  real  estate  project  in  Xian,  China.  The results indicate that this approach has the potential to improve the efficiency and quality of preliminary plan.
