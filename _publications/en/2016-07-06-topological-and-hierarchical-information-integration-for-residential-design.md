Abstract
====

Standard-unit is a residential design template which is concluded from flats sharing the same layout, similar decorating style, and same kind of furniture and appliances. Conventional way to implement standard-unit is to use standard design drawings. Such drawings are mainly kept as hard-copies or CAD digital files, which lacks semantic information and makes it difficult to fully utilize the standard-units. Building Information Model/Modeling (BIM) technology provides a solution to enhance the implementation of standard-unit. In this study, we first developed a series of algorithm to extract semantic, topological and hierarchical information from IFC-files. Then a topological and hierarchical information integration approach was proposed for standard-unit-based residential planning. A prototype database and modeling system were also developed to demonstrate this approach. Both the database and modeling system were tested with real project data. The application indicates that the proposed approach can efficiently integrate topological and hierarchical information in the residential project.
