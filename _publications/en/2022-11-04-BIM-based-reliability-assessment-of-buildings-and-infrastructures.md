 Reliability evaluation plays a crucial role in the design, operation and maintenance of building and infrastructure facilities. Meanwhile building information modelling (BIM) technology has been widely used in life cycle assessment (LCA), rule checking and lean construction for its advantages in multi-platform collaboration and  digital  modelling.  However,  in  the  combination  of  traditional  reliability  theory  and  BIM-based  life  cycle assessment  is  still  lacking,  especially  for  component  level  computations.  This  paper  proposes  a  reliability assessment framework based on BIM to realize the complementarity of these two technologies. The method is developed based on reliability model of different facilities and data interoperability function of BIM technology. The former considers the randomness and degradation effect of a c omponent, and the later makes it possible to transmit  and  share  data  information  among  different  platforms.  A  reliability  assessment  example  for  a reliability-based  design  for  a  four-story  reinforced  concrete fram e  structure  are perform ed  to  demonstrate  the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can easily transform the design information in BIM into reliability information and the reliability for each component can well feedback to BIM model. The calculated reliability index can provide more valuable reference and theoretical basis for life cycle assessment.
