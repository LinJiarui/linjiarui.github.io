Abstract
====

Based on the characteristics and the actual demand of construction management in China, the technical framework, system process and the countermeasures of BIM application in construction are proposed．Then by combining BIM and 4D technology, series softwares like BIM modeling system and 4D construction dynamic management system based on BIM are developed independently, thereby forming an integrated solution for BIM implementation in construction．The research results has been successfully applied to many large construction projects such as the National Stadium, thus proving the feasibility and applicability of the integrated solution, and illustrating the application value and prospects of BIM technology in construction.
