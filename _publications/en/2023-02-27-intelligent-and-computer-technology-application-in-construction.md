====

The construction industry is faced with many challenges, such as lagging productivity [1], labor sustainability [2], and environmental sustainability [3]. Intelligent construction provides a solution to these challenges. In the past two decades, significant efforts have been devoted to enhancing the construction project delivery process using intelligent and computer technologies. Examples include, but are not limited to, smart site supervision [4], construction robotics [5], automatic safety [6], and health management with the IoT [7]. This Special Issue aims to provide a platform to explore state-of-the-art knowledge, practical implementation, and cutting-edge innovations in the area of intelligent and computer technologiesâ€™ application in construction. A total of fourteen original research studies have been published, with contributions from international research groups. All these contributions address the main topics of this Special Issue with an effective and targeted effort.

he guest editors would like to acknowledge all the authors for their scientific support and kind sharing of their knowledge. The editors would like to express their gratitude to the peer reviewers for their rigorous analysis of manuscripts as well as the managing editors of Buildings involved in this Special Issue for their continuous support.
