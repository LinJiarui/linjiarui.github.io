Topologies of space and Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) are crucial to a building’s design and maintenance. Traditionally, the information storage is fragmented and is difficult to extract and utilize. Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology realizes the uniform description, storage, and management of various professional information, which can significantly improve the extraction and application efficiency of topology information. This paper introduces the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), proposes an integrated topology model of space and MEP, and studies the technology of extracting and integrating the topological information. A prototype system is developed and tested. The result shows that the proposed model can avoid re-modeling, utilize BIM’s rich information, and realize the integrated application.
