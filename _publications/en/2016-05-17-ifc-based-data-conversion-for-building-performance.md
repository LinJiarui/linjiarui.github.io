Abstract
====

To eliminate effort needed in data conversion and sharing for building performance analysis, an IFC-based data conversion algorithm to automatically convert BIM model to gbXML was proposed for building performance information sharing. First, by analysis the structure of IFC and gbXML, the mapping relationship between IFC and gbXML was established. Then, an automatic conversion algorithm was proposed based on the mapping relationships established before. Finally, the proposed algorithm was validated with different project data. Results illustrate that the proposed algorithm is effective and feasible for building performance information sharing among different stakeholders, thus eliminating rework in data modeling and improving efficiency.
