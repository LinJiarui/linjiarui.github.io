Performance-based design is a commonly used method in fire protection design. Performance-based design needs to evaluate the performance a design in different scenarios, where manual evaluation methods are time-consuming and error-prone. However, most of the current researches on automated compliance checking are based on descriptive design specifications, and there are still few studies considering performance-based design requirements. Therefore, this paper proposes a performance-based compliance checking method of fire protection design based on knowledge graphs. First, the performance-based fire protection design ontology is constructed as the logical framework of the knowledge graph. Then based on the SWRL rules, the automatic identification, generation and checking methods of different performance-based scenarios are realized. Finally, case study is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
