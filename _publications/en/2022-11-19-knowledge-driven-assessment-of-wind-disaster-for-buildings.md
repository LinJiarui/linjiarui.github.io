Pre-disaster assessment and post-disaster response are very important for disaster prevention and mitigation. Nowadays, though results of mainstream test and simulation methods are accurate enough, they require strict constraints on the computational resources, extensive knowledge of experts, and are always expensive. By collecting previous wind disaster data and incorporating machine learning, nearest neighbor retrieval, knowledge mapping and other technologies, this research implements methods for the prediction of building damages, retrieval of similar cases, and automatic question and answer, therefore building a disaster assessment platform for building wind environment to realize the rapid prediction and judgment of building damages induced by wind disasters, which helps the strategy development for wind isaster response.
