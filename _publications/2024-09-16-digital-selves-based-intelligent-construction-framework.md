建筑业是我国国民经济的支柱产业，但近年来利润率持续下滑，传统以岗位为中心的建筑业信息系统已不能满足安全、质量、效率的要求。针对上述问题，提出了以工人、设备、现场为中心的基于数字孪生的智能建造架构，改变了传统以岗位为中心的建筑业信息系统，实现了各部门、各环节信息的有效协同。将基于数字孪生的智能建造架构应用于案例，很好地解决了信息共享问题，同时保证了信息的真实性和可靠性，提高了各参与方的管理效率和信息系统化，使企业和工人能够更全面地了解自身，及时有效地制定应对风险的策略，有效提升了建筑业的数字化、自动化和智能化水平，使治理更加精准、有效。

Construction is the pillar industry of Chinese national economy, but the profit rate has continued to decline in recent years. The conventional job-centric construction information system cannot meet the requirements for safety, quality, and efficiency. In order to solve the above problems, a digital selves based intelligent construction framework has been proposed which is centred on workers, equipment, and sites. It changes the conventional job-centered construction information system and realizes efficient coordination of information among various departments and stages. Applying the digital selves based intelligent construction framework to the case has been proved to be a good solution to the problem of information sharing. Meanwhile, the authenticity and reliability of the information have been ensured. The system has improved management efficiency and information systematization for all participants. It has enabled companies and workers to have a more comprehensive understanding of themselves and to make timely and effective strategies against hazards. In addition, the system has effectively raised the level of digitalization, automation, and intelligence of construction, making governance more accurate and more effective.
