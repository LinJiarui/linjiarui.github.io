信息和通信技术 (ICT) 在建筑(AEC) 行业知识管理 (KM) 中发挥着至关重要的作用。AEC行业是典型知识密集型行业，鉴于其复杂性和动态性特征，在知识管理方面面临着独特的挑战。为了分析示 ICT 在 AEC 行业知识管理中的最新进展，本文对行业近15年来的 89 篇相关文献进行了系统调研和综述。研究表明，行业知识管理体现了从本体、语义网络再到知识图谱的清晰发展脉络。研究同时探讨了不同 ICT 技术的相互作用及其在知识管理过程中的优劣势。同时，研究发现学术研究和行业应用之间具有显著差异，实际应用面临认知障碍和评价标准缺失等系列问题。最后，本文从研究和应用两个层面指出了未来的发展方向。

Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) play a vital role in the knowledge management (KM) of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, which is knowledge intensive and yet faces unique challenges in managing knowledge due to its complex and dynamic nature. In order to show the state-of-the-art of ICTs for knowledge management in the AEC industry, this paper conducts a fifteen-year review of 89 related papers and reports from the industry. A clear line of key technologies evolving from ontology, semantic network to knowledge graph has been revealed from the collected literature. The interactions between different ICTs, as well as their advantages and disadvantages for different knowledge management process are discussed. The study also finds certain imbalance in the development of the industry and academia, as well as cognitive barriers and lack of evaluation standards. Suggestions for future development are also proposed to benefit the research community and relevant practitioners.
