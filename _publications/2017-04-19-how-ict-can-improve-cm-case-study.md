摘要
====

Information technology such as Building Information Modeling, 3D-printing provides an innovative approach for construction project management, aiming at increasing efficiency, improving quality and reducing cost. Construction corporations in mainland China are making active attempts to increase the informatization level in construction projects. This paper discusses Beijing Headquarter building project of Tencent as a case study for the information technology application in the construction phase in terms of how information technology can improve construction management for general contractor. 

The project for case study is designed as a large public building located in Beijing, with a footprint area of 334,386 square meters. Considering the complexity of the structure, tight schedule and difficulties in detailed construction, various of attempts of information technology application have been made in the project, including 4D-BIM integrated management, 3D-printing, construction simulation. These attempts cover schedule, quality, safety and cost management, resulting in reduction of redundant work, optimized detailed design, improved efficiency, etc. This paper examines the process of each application and analyzes the necessity of each technique by comparing the benefits and the devotion. This project won the first prize in “Longtu Cup” national BIM competition in 2015 and held an exhibition presenting information technology application. 

The paper also discusses the value and challenges appeared during the application of information technology in the case. Information technology application can result in resource and workload reduction, problem solving in advance and realizing precise management, thus improving construction management for general contractor. However, promoting information technology application can be challenging at first, given the management team is not familiar enough with the techniques. Countermeasures are proposed regarding the challenges and difficulties arose in the case.
