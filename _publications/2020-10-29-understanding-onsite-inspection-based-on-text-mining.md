As an essential way to ensure success of construction projects, on-site inspection involves intensive paperwork, while generating large amounts of textual data. Lack of understanding of information hidden  in  text-based  inspection  records  always  leads  to  overlooking  of  important  issues  and  deferred decisions.  Therefore,  a  novel  text  mining  approach  based  on  keyword  extraction  and  topic  modeling  is introduced to identify key concerns and their dynamics of on-site issues for better decision-making process. Then, the proposed approach was demonstrated in a real world project and tested with 7250 issue records. Results showed that the proposed method could successfully extract key concerns hidden in texts and identify their changes with time, thereby enabling a more efficient on-site inspection and data-centric decision-making 
process.  This  research  contributes:  (1)  to  the  body  of  knowledge  a  new  framework  for  discovering  key concerns and their changes with time in texts, and (2) to the state of practice by providing insights on hot topics and their changes with time to reduce on-site issues and make decisions efficiently.
